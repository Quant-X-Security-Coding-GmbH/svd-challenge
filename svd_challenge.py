# Singular value decomposition. The command linalg.svd will return U,V^H,
# and o as an array of the singular values. To obtain the matrix Î£, use
# linalg.diagsvd. The following example illustrates the use of linalg.svd:
def decompositionSingular():
    A = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
    M, N = A.shape
    U, s, Vh = linalg.svd(A)
    Sig = linalg.diagsvd(s, M, N)
    U, Vh = U, Vh
    print(U)
    print(Sig)
    print(Vh)
    print(U.dot(Sig.dot(Vh)))  #check computation
